## Communication
* I tend to reply to email quickly. If I don't, please allow me until Sunday 10AM of that week to get back to you.
* I will acknowledge/respond to all emails within 2 business days.
* I will do office hours on an as-needed, appointment-based system. Please ask your questions on the channel first, and schedule a meeting when suggestions on the channel aren't helping. Use the link on the top to schedule a meeting with me or the TA.

## Feedback and Solution
* Assignments will be graded and returned within 10 days of the due date.
  * except for the first few weeks when a TA hasn't yet been assigned.
* The first 3 people to indicate to me that they've seen this line here, may reach out for 2 extra-credit points.
* Most of the assignments will be accompanied by a suite of automated tests that can give you an early feedback on your work.
  * For most assignment, passing tests means full grade.
* The solutions will be shared using a secret code to be shared with you on the assignment feedback.
