## Attendance
Students at the University of Cincinnati are expected to attend classes in order to meet the learning objectives for the course. Students are expected to follow the class attendance policy as outlined by the instructor. Students participating in official University sponsored activities, where the student is representing the University, will meet with instructor related to absences due to university-sponsored activities. When such absences occur, students need to provide documentation of the event(s), and work with the professor to develop a written plan for completion of missed assignments or other course requirements with as much advance notice as possible.

## Communication
All university business must be conducted **using a university assigned email account**. The use of a personal, or non-university assigned email account to conduct university business is strictly prohibited. [See full policy here](https://www.uc.edu/content/dam/uc/infosec/docs/policies/Electronic_Mail_Policy_9_1_4.pdf).

## Class Cancellation Policy: 
In the rare case that a class must be cancelled, faculty will post an announcement on the LMS that will be emailed to students.  Faculty will attempt to communicate class cancellations with as much advance notice as possible. Students should be sure that their LMS email is current and valid to ensure emails are received. If the University closes due to inclement weather or other emergency situations, there will be an announcement posted on Canvas (LMS) and if possible on the local news channels (TV and radio).  Communications related to University closures will also be sent to the student‚Äôs cell phone number on record through the automatic University emergency text messaging system. Students should notify the University if they change their cell phone number to ensure they will receive these important emergency communications.

## Academic Integrity
The University of Cincinnati is committed to academic integrity. A formal articulation of this commitment is articulated in the Student Code of Conduct. Any violation of these rules, including plagiarism or cheating will be handled on a case-by-case basis. At the least, you should anticipate a zero on an assignment, at the fullest extent, your violation will be reported to the university and the incident will be documented on your permanent record.

## Accessibility and Special Needs
The University of Cincinnati is committed to providing all students with equal access to learning opportunities.
