## Coursework Submissions

### Quality Expectation üèÖ
- Make sure to closely follow the instructions and submit work in the specified formats.
- Make sure to always review and adhere to the the [Code Style Guide](/guides/code-style) when working on your assignments

## Grading Procedure
* Assignments will be graded based on:
  * [Your self assessment and evaluation](#self-assessment-and-grading).
  * Assignment automated tests and checks.
  * Code and Assignment Review.
  * For Group Assignments, peer evaluation will be taken into consideration

### Late Policy ‚è≥
* No late Quizzes will be accepted once the due date has passed.
* 20% of the assignment total would be deducted for every late day.
  * *i.e., 5 late days = 20% √ó 5 days = 0.*

:::danger No Exceptions

### Self Assessment and Grading
* All assignments will have a self-assessment and a self-reflection sections. You're required to provide:
  * Self-reflection
    * How long did it take you to complete the assignment?
    * What do you think of this completion time?
    * With hindsight, what would you do differently getting started with this assignments, now that you know what you know? 
  * Self-assessment of the grade you think you deserve with justifications.
    * If you complete all the required items on the assignment checklist and they work, give your self the full grade.
    * If you leave out some of the required items, or you're not sure if you satisfied all the requirements, or think you've done everything but it still doesn't work properly, deduct a few points and justify that in the comments.
      * When grading you may receive higher grade that you gave your self üòâ.
    * If nothing works (but you tried) and we can see that you tried in the code, give your self half the points.
    * If you say you did something when you didn't or not submit the assignment at all, you'll receive zero points for the assignment.
      * be honest .
      * be active.
  
## Course Evaluation üëç
The School of Information Technology requires that each course is evaluated each time it is taught.  The School uses a confidential web-based system, CoursEval, for these evaluations.  At the beginning of finals week,you will receive an email from the School Head, with ‚ÄúCoursEval‚Äù as the topic.  There is a link on that email that takes you directly to the evaluation.  The online system is anonymous.  I will receive only a summary report of combined data after final grades have been submitted.

As an instructor, I greatly value your input regarding the strengths and areas for improvement of this course.  Your feedback is essential for me to continually improve instruction and provide for quality student learning and outcomes.
