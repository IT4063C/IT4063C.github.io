## Communication
* I will acknowledge/respond to all emails within 2 business days.
  * I will grant you an additional slip day for each day beyond the 2-day window if I don't respond in time. (see: [the late policy](policies#late-policy-))
* I will do office hours on an as-needed, appointment-based system. Please ask your questions on the channel first, and schedule a meeting when suggestions on the channel aren't helping. Use the link on the top to schedule a meeting with me or the TA.

### Am I available during weekends?
No 🚫

### Will I be responding to questions during the weekend?
Maybe. 🤷‍♂️ Depends on my weekend plans.

*But should you expect it?* **No**

## Feedback and Solution
* Assignments will be graded and returned within 10 days of the due date.
  * except for the first few weeks when a TA hasn't yet been assigned.
* The first 3 people to indicate to me that they've seen this line here, may reach out for 2 extra-credit points.
* Most of the assignments will be accompanied by a suite of automated tests that can give you an early feedback on your work.
  * Passing all the tests ≠ full grade.
* The solutions will be shared via a secret code to be shared with you on the assignment feedback.
