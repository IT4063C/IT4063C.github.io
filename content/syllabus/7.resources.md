## Tools and Software Needed
### Git and GitHub
We will be learning about and using the Source Version Control tool, [GitHub](https://github.com) in this class. This is how you'll be submitting your assignments and how I will be sharing solutions. You will need to:
* Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) tools to your computer.
  * If prompted on installation, please choose to also install Git Bash.
* Create a GitHub Account on [GitHub.com](https://github.com/)
    * optionally, Sign up for the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)
    * you can follow the following guide for [Applying for a student developer pack - GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/en/articles/applying-for-a-student-developer-pack)

### Visual Studio Code
I will be using (and recommend you do too) [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) as my Text Editor/IDE. **This is not the same as Visual Studio** that you may have used in C# classed. I will be sharing some recommendations for extensions and configurations that will make your developer experience easier.

### Python
We will be using Python 3.10.5 - Latest version at the time of building this course.
