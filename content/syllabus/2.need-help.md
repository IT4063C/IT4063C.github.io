- If you're looking for ways to implement something, break down the your challenge, to smaller tasks and search for the smaller 
- When looking up answers on StackOverFlow, Be careful that you only use Answers to questions that are quite recent (or uses the same versions as yours). Programming moves quickly!

## Study Group 👨🏽‍💻👩🏼‍💻👨🏾‍💻👨🏻‍💻👩🏽‍💻👨🏼‍💻👩🏾‍💻👩🏻‍💻
**highly recommended**
Many students learn better and faster when working in a group, so I encourage collaborative learning. You can work together in a study group with 2–4 students to discuss class materials, homework assignments, and projects on a weekly basis. However, each student must submit their work individually; your work should reflect your own understanding of the materials.
