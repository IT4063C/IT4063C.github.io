When working through the course materials and assignments, you may get faced with a technical challenge (ok, you will 👉👈). This guide is help you get your self unstuck.
## Clear your mind 😌
If you're stuck for a long while, pause ⏸️. Clear your mind. If you're able, Take a walk 🚶‍♂️🚶‍♀️. Studies show that short walks [improve memory and thinking skills](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/regular-exercise-changes-brain-improve-memory-thinking-skills-201404097110).

## Break down the Problem
Back from your walk, re-evaluate the problem with fresh eyes. It's critical for you to develop a nack for [breaking down a problem to smaller parts](/blog/break-down-problems) before seeking out help.

## Search Online 🕵️‍♂️🕵️‍♀️
Knowing how to find your answers online is a *key skill* for you to develop.

For best results:
- Make sure you're asking the right questions. This means, you've [broken down your challenge to a small enough part](/blog/break-down-problems) that you can search for.
- Make sure you're the answer you find is a recent one. 
  - Technology changes, and what worked before, may not work now.
  - At least make sure the response uses the same version of the technology you're using.

## Study Group 👨🏽‍💻👩🏼‍💻👨🏾‍💻👨🏻‍💻👩🏽‍💻👨🏼‍💻👩🏾‍💻👩🏻‍💻
**highly recommended**
Many students learn better and faster when working in a group, so I encourage collaborative learning. You can work together in a study group with 2–4 students to discuss class materials, homework assignments, and projects on a weekly basis. However, each student must submit their work individually; your work should reflect your own understanding of the materials.

## Ask MS Team's `Questions ❓` Channel 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♂️
Still no, luck? ask your question on *[Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a30e5da231a654578a9f04859d49dc410%40thread.tacv2/%25F0%259F%2586%2598%2520Help%2520-%2520Ask%2520Questions?groupId=24ca8848-d758-42dc-9a5f-85467f5ded68&tenantId=f5222e6c-5fc6-48eb-8f03-73db18203b63)*.
  * While I'll do my best to get to your questions as soon as I can, but I will almost always be beat by your fellow classmates.
  * It's a great learning opportunity for you to help other students or to engage in technical discussion to find the answer together.
  * If a TA is assigned to the class, they'll also be monitoring the chat and responding to your questions.
  * If you're not able to come to resolution, please @me/mention me on the question thread.
* I will try to periodically check on the questions, comment or correct any answers.
* I highly advise, you regularly check your classmates questions and participate.
