## Grading Procedure
* Individual assignments will be graded based on:
  * [Your self assessment and evaluation](#self-assessment-and-grading).
  * Assignment automated tests and checks.
  * Code and Assignment Review.

* Group assignments will be graded based on:
  * [the Team's self assessment and evaluation](#self-assessment-and-grading).
  * Assignment automated tests and checks.
  * Code and Assignment Review.
  * Peer evaluation. (Further instructions will be shared)

### Self Assessment and Grading
* All assignments will have a `README.md` file at the root directory of the project.
* On the self assessment, you're required to provide:
  * Self-reflection
  * Self-assessment of the grade you think you deserve with justifications.
    * If you complete all the required items on the assignment checklist and they work, give your self the full grade.
    * If you leave out some of the required items, or you're not sure if you satisfied all the requirements, or think you've done everything but it still doesn't work properly, deduct a few points and justify that in the comments.
      * When grading you may receive higher grade that you gave your self ðŸ˜‰.
    * If nothing works (but you tried) and we can see that you tried in the code, give your self half the points.
    * If you say you did something when you didn't or not submit the assignment at all, you'll receive zero points for the assignment.
      * be honest .
      * be active.
