## Overview

This is checkpoint #2 of your final project. It builds on what you've done in [checkpoint #1](./checkpoint1).

In the past few weeks we addressed a few key topics in data science: data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization. In this checkpoint, you will be asked to apply these skills to your final project dataset. You will also be asked to plan how you can apply machine learning in your project.

## What the checkpoint should include

Building on what you've submitted in checkpoint 1, address the comments and feedback provided by your peers and/or instructor and Include the following.

- **Start Exploring the data you've collected  
**Hopefully, you're found more datasets for your project. At this stage, start performing an exploratory data analysis of your data:
  - What insights and interesting information are you able to extract at this stage?
  - How does it help you address the problem you're set to research in this project?
  - What issues can you see in your data at this point?
- **Data Cleaning**
  - Remove duplicates
  - address missing data points
  - address outliers and anomalies in your data
- **Exploratory Data Visualizations**
At this point in the project, you're still exploring the data that you have. Trying to see what other data you may need to answer your questions. For 
  - show 3-5 diagrams representing different valuable aspects of the data you have.
  - provide a write-up on why this visualization was used?
  - Provide a write-up on the value derived from the visuals you generated.
  - Provide a write-up on how this information will help answer your project's questions.
- **Preparing for Machine Learning**
  - Based on your problem domain, what type of machine learning will you need for your project?
  - Based on the challenges of machine learning we discussed, what challenges are you expecting to face, and how are you planning to address it?
- **Address the last checkpoint's peer review feedback.**

You'll also be required to provide a peer review of **one** of your fellow classmates' work. You'll have access to their submission and will need to provide thoughtful feedback. Your feedback isn't limited to the project idea and design but also to the coding practices followed. The assignment resources include links to the Warm-Cool-Hard Feedback protocol and the clean code practices document on the course's website. You're encouraged to draw on your own personal and industrial experience in your feedback.

## Due Dates

- Assignment Due Date: Oct 16, 2022
- Peer-Review Due Date: Oct 23, 2022

## Submission

**You will be submitting the same GitHub Repository Link you submitted for Checkpoint 1.**

**Please check the rubric for details on how you'll be graded on this assignment.**
