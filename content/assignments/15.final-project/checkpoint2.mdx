## Context
This is checkpoint #2 of your final project. It builds on what you've done in [checkpoint #1](./checkpoint1).

:::info Keep in Mind
Nothing that you've done in checkpoint 1 is set in stone. You can always go back and change your dataset, your question, or your approach. This checkpoint is meant to help you refine your project and make sure that you are on the right track.
:::

IT work is never linear, it's always iterative and incremental. You will be making changes to your project as you go. This is a good thing! It means that you are learning and growing as a data scientist.

## Overview
In the past few weeks we addressed a few key topics in data science: data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization. In this checkpoint, you will be asked to apply these skills to your final project dataset. You will also be asked to plan how you can apply machine learning in your project.

## What the checkpoint should include
In addition to addressing any feedback that was provided to you by your peers and/or the teaching team, your checkpoint should include the following sections:

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
You may have (hopefully) found more datasets for your project. If so, you should include them under the "Data Sources" section.
If not, that means that so far your data is able to answer your analysis 
Apply EDA and use Visualizations to answer questions such as:
- What insights and interesting information are you able to extract at this stage?
- What are the distributions of my variables?
- Are there any correlations between my variables?
- What issues can you see in your data at this point?
- Are there any outliers or anomalies? are they relevant to your analysis? or should they be removed?
- Are there any missing values? how are you going to deal with them?
- Are there any duplicate values? how are you going to deal with them?
- Are there any data types that need to be changed?

#### Data Visualization
You should use several visualizations to help answer the questions above. 
- You should have at least 4 visualizations in your notebook, to represent different aspects and valuable insights of your data. 
- You can use 2 visualization library that you want.
- You can use any type of visualization that best represents your data.
  - You'll need to provide a short description of each visualization and explain what it represents, and what insights you can extract from it.

### 2. Data Cleaning and Wrangling
Describe the data cleaning process you went through to prepare your data for analysis. This should include a description of the data cleaning steps you took, and the code you used to perform these steps. You should also include a description of any data cleaning steps you did not take, and why you chose not to take them. Finally, you should include a description of any data cleaning steps you took that you are not sure were correct, and why you are not sure they were correct.

### 3. Machine Learning Plan
  - Based on your problem domain, what type of machine learning will you need for your project?
  - Based on the challenges of machine learning we discussed, what challenges are you expecting to face, and how are you planning to address it?

### 4. Prior Feedback and Updates
  - What feedback did you receive from your peers and/or the teaching team?
  - What changes have you made to your project based on this feedback?


## Due Dates
- Assignment Due Date: Oct 16, 2022
- Peer-Review Due Date: Oct 23, 2022

## Submission

You'll also be required to provide a peer review of **one** of your fellow classmates' work. You'll have access to their submission and will need to provide thoughtful feedback. Your feedback isn't limited to the project idea and design but also to the coding practices followed. The assignment resources include links to the Warm-Cool-Hard Feedback protocol and the clean code practices document on the course's website. You're encouraged to draw on your own personal and industrial experience in your feedback.

**You will be submitting the same GitHub Repository Link you submitted for Checkpoint 1.**

**Please check the rubric for details on how you'll be graded on this assignment.**

*  *  *

(1) Feedback can be found on the discussion board, on the assignment submission AND on the different components on the assignment rubric (make sure you check in all 3 places)
