* Science is about the ability to repeat experiments, and data science and analytics is no different.
* Setting up a data science environment is about having a reproducible environment, and having a reproducible workflow.

### Reproducible Data Science Environment
* Ability to get the same exact dependencies: Package management
* Ability to have multiple project with different dependencies on the same machine: Virtual Environment management
* Ability to have multiple versions on Python on the same machine: Version Management
