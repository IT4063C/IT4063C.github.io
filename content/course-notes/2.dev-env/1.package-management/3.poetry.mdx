## Overview
> Poetry is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you. [^1]

* Poetry is very similar to PipEnv.
* It, also, doesn't come with Python by default, so you'll need to install it first.
* Two major benfits over pip are (same as pipenv):
  - Dependencies are installed in a virtualenv, so you don't have to worry about installing them in the system path.
  - It automatically captures installed dependencies in files to generate an exact replica of the environment packages.
    * I'd then check the dependeinces file into my code repository and is always available for me to use and share.
    * Unlike in pip where you specifically need to freeze a snapshot of the entire virtual env with all of its dependencies.
    * It generates 2 files: `poetry.lock` and `pyproject.toml`.

## Cheatsheet
* To start using Poetry, you'll need to initialize a project.
  - `poetry init`
  - `poetry install`

*  To install a package
    ```bash
    poetry add <package>
    ```

* To install a specific version of a package
    ```bash
    poetry add <package>@<version>
    ```

* To upgrade a package
    ```bash
    poetry update <package>
    ```

* To uninstall a package
    ```bash
    poetry remove <package>
    ```

* To Search for packages
    ```bash
    poetry search <package>
    ```
