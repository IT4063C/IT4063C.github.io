## Overview
> Poetry is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you. [^1]

For me, One major benfit of using poetry over pip, is that fact that any module I install is automatically added to the `pyproject.toml` file.
Which I'd then check into my code repository and is always available to me.
Unlike in pip where you specifically need to freeze a snapshot of the entire virtual env with all of its dependencies.
