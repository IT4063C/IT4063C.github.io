PIP is a standard python command for package management systems, this is used to install, upgrade, and uninstall the software packages that are written in python. PIP package manager is similar to another tool that comes with another language. You might be familiar with them as JavaScript uses npm, Dot Net uses NuGet, and Ruby uses the gem package manager. In python, PIP comes up with a python installer in current versions. To verify the PIP availability use this command on the command prompt

Let's start with the language of Python. Python is popular not only because it is easy to learn, but also because it has thousands of treasure libraries.

These libraries are equivalent to already integrated tools that can be used in Python as long as they are installed. They can handle all kinds of problems without you having to reinvent the wheel, and as the community continues to update and maintain, some libraries are getting stronger and stronger, almost comparable to enterprise-level applications.

So how to download and install these tool libraries? They are placed in a unified “repository” called PyPi (Python Package Index), from which all library installations are dispatched.

As of Python 3.4, pip is already built into Python, so no need to install it again.
