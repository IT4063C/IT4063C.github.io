This guide will help you get started with the tools you need to build a Python environment for Data Analytics.

## Python3

## Anaconda
When installing packages in python using pip, it installs globally across your entire maching. This is not ideal for Data Analytics or for any project for that matter. You may be working on multiple projects, each of which requires a certain version of the same package. Anaconda is a python distribution that is specifically designed to allows you to setup virtual envirnoments, install packages there.

## IDE
I will be using this VSCode for this class, but you can use any IDE you like. I'm including instructions on getting the ultimate edition for the PyCharm for free.

## Docker

## Tableau
