**SQL**, or Structured Query Language, is a language to talk to databases. It allows you to select specific data and to build complex reports. Today, SQL is a universal language of data. It is used in practically all technologies that process data.

## SAMPLE DATA

![Sample data](./01-sample-data.png)

## QUERYING SINGLE TABLE

Fetch all columns from the country table:
```sql 
SELECT *
FROM country;
```

Fetch id and name columns from the city table:
```sql
SELECT id, name
FROM city;
```

Fetch city names sorted by the rating column in the default ASCending order:
```sql
SELECT name
FROM city
ORDER BY rating [ASC];
```

Fetch city names sorted by the rating column in the DESCending order:
```sql
SELECT name
FROM city
ORDER BY rating DESC;
```

## ALIASES

### COLUMNS
```sql
SELECT name AS city_name
FROM city;
```
### TABLES
```sql
SELECT co.name, ci.name
FROM city AS ci
JOIN country AS co
  ON ci.country_id = co.id;
```
## FILTERING THE OUTPUT
### COMPARISON OPERATORS

Fetch names of cities that have a rating above 3:
```sql
SELECT name
FROM city
WHERE rating > 3;
```
Fetch names of cities that are neither Berlin nor Madrid:
```sql
SELECT name
FROM city
WHERE name != 'Berlin'
  AND name != 'Madrid';
```

### TEXT OPERATORS

Fetch names of cities that start with a 'P' or end with an 's':
```sql
SELECT name
FROM city
WHERE name LIKE 'P%'
  OR name LIKE '%s';
```
Fetch names of cities that start with any letter followed by 'ublin' (like Dublin in Ireland or Lublin in Poland):
```sql
SELECT name
FROM city
WHERE name LIKE '%ublin';
```
### OTHER OPERATORS

Fetch names of cities that have a population between 500K and 5M:
```sql
SELECT name
FROM city
WHERE population BETWEEN 500000 AND 5000000;
```
Fetch names of cities that don't miss a rating value:
```sql
SELECT name
FROM city
WHERE rating IS NOT NULL;
```
Fetch names of cities that are in countries with IDs 1, 4, 7, or 8:
```sql
SELECT name
FROM city
WHERE country_id IN (1, 4, 7, 8);
```

## QUERYING MULTIPLE TABLES

### INNER JOIN

JOIN (or explicitly INNER JOIN) returns rows that have matching values in both tables.
```sql
SELECT city.name, country.name
FROM city
[INNER] JOIN country
  ON city.country_id = country.id;
```

![Tables joined using INNER JOIN](./02-inner-join.png)
### LEFT JOIN

LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left table with corresponding rows from the right table. If there's no matching row, NULLs are returned as values from the second table.
```sql
SELECT city.name, country.name
FROM city
LEFT JOIN country
  ON city.country_id = country.id;
```
![Tables joined using LEFT JOIN](./03-left-join.png)

### RIGHT JOIN
RIGHT JOIN returns all rows from the right table with corresponding rows from the left table. If there's no matching row, NULLs are returned as values from the left table.
```sql
SELECT city.name, country.name
FROM city
RIGHT JOIN country
  ON city.country_id = country.id;
```

### FULL JOIN

FULL JOIN (or explicitly FULL OUTER JOIN) returns all rows from both tables â€“ if there's no matching row in the second table, NULLs are returned.
```sql
SELECT city.name, country.name
FROM city
FULL [OUTER] JOIN country
  ON city.country_id = country.id;
```
![Tables joined using FULL JOIN](./05-full-join.png)

### CROSS JOIN

CROSS JOIN returns all possible combinations of rows from both tables. There are two syntaxes available.
```sql
SELECT city.name, country.name
FROM city
CROSS JOIN country;
```
```sql
SELECT city.name, country.name
FROM city, country;
```
