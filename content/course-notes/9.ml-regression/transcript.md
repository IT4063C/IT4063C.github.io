# Machine Learning Process
# =======================
#
# 1. Define the problem
# 2. Collect the data
# 3. Prepare the data
# 4. Evaluate the algorithms
# 5. Improve the results
# 6. Present the results

- start with the types of ML problems and the types of ML algorithms
- Frame the problem and look at the big picture
  - are we trying to get an estimate for the price
  - or just a category indicating (cheap, medium, expensive), in that case, accuracy is not important, and this could become a classification problem
- selecting a performance measure
  - RSME
  - MAE
  - both of theses are ways to measure the distance between two vectors (the vectors are the predictions and the labels)
- introduce cost function
- introduce the terminology and notations
- Splitting the data into training and test sets
- Computers don't generate truly random numbers, so we need to set the seed

- Feature Scaling
  - https://towardsdatascience.com/all-about-feature-scaling-bcc0ad75cb35

- scikit-learn has:
  - estimators
  - transformers
  - predictors
  - They can be chained together using pipelines



```python
from sklearn import linear_model
import pandas as pd

X = [[0, 0], [1, 1], [2, 2]]
y = [0, 1, 2]
df = pd.DataFrame(X, columns=['x1', 'x2'])
df['y'] = y
display(df)

reg = linear_model.LinearRegression()
reg.fit(df[["x1", "x2"]], df['y']).coef_

# Classification
this week will talk about one of the supervised learning technique typically used in predicting the classes

# Regression
This week we'll talk about one supervised learning technique and algorithm. which is used to predict (continuous) values.
it's a statistical tool for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (the target) and one or more independent variables (explantory variable).

For example, we might want to predict the price of a house given its size, or the number of hours a student will study given the number of hours they slept the night before. We'll also talk about how to evaluate the performance of a regression model, and how to use regression to make predictions.

## Notes
- feature scaling is important for gradient descent
- explain how the algorithm works
- data splitting
