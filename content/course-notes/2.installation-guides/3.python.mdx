## Installation 
## For Windows
you can either install python from the [Python Official Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/), or from Microsoft Store on your computer.

**I, personally, had a smoother experience using the Microsoft Store.**

You may need to updated the `PATH` environment variable after installation. Your installer will indicate if you need to do that.

## For macOS
macOS used to come with Python 2.7 pre-installed. This is an old version that we will not be using in this class.
<br />
To get the latest version of Python, you can install if from the <a alt="official python link" href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python Official Website</a>.

### Homebrew for macOS
I recommend that you Install [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/) and use that to download the latest version of python.

Homebrew is a utility tool that will allow to install a lot of command line tools and applications easily using a simple command line interface.

Once you have HomeBrew installed, you'll be able to run the following command from your terminal to get the latest version of python
```bash
brew install python
``` 
Many of the following tools can also be easily installed using homebrew.

## Checking For the Installation
Once done with the installation, you can run the following command in your terminal application
```bash
python --version
```
OR
```bash
python3 --version
```
OR 
```bash
py --version
```
at least one of those commands should return the version of python that you have installed
