## What is Machine Learning (ML)?

> A computer program is said to learn from Experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.
> 
> _Tom M. Chitchell_

- **Experience E**: the data we feed to the algorithm and the algorithm's actions on that data
- **Tasks T**: the tasks the algorithm is supposed to perform.
  - OCR, image classification, spam detection, Medical Diagnosis by analyzing patient data and finding patterns, ...etc.
- **Performance measure P**: the measure of the algorithm's performance and accuracy

## Applications of ML

## Types of ML Systems:
1. Supervision Types:
  - Supervised Learning
  - Semi-Supervised Learning
  - Reinforcement Learning
2. Batch vs. Online Learning:
  - Batch Learning
  - Online Learning
3. Instance-Based vs Model-Based Learning
  - Instance-Based Learning
  - Model-Based Learning  


## Challenges of ML
1. Insufficient Quantity of Training Data
2. Nonrepresentative Training Data
3. Poor-Quality Data
4. Irrelevant Features
5. Overfitting the Training Data
6. Underfitting the Training Data

## Hands-on ML

## From Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow
the main steps:
1. Look at the Big Picture
2. Get the data.
3. Discover and Visualize the data data to gain insight
4. Prepare the Data for Machine Learning Algorithms
5. Select a model and train it.
6. Fine Tune your model.
7. Present your solution.
8. Launch, monitor, and maintain your system.
