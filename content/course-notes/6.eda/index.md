## Should data cleaning be a separate module

## Topic plan:
- In the beginning there was hypothesis testing (confirmatory analysis)
- John Tukey in 1961 found that there was a need for a kind of analysis where the hypotheses were suggested by the data
- That's when comes Exploratory analysis



## Data Preparation

## Data Wrangling and Cleaning

> "Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way." - Leo Tolstoy

### Characteristics of tidy data:
- Every variable/attribute/feature forms a column
- Every observation forms a row
- Every type of observational unit forms a table

### Characteristics of untidy data:
$%@#$%^#@$%

- a dataset that's tidy for one analysis can be untidy for another analysis.
