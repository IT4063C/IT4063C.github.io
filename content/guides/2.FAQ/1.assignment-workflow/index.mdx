title: Assignment Workflow
---

For all lab assignments, we'll be using GitHub Classroom to manage the assignment starter files, and automated feedback workflow
## 1. Get the starter files for the assignment

1. On Cavnas, click on the GitHub Classroom Assignment link.
  <img src={require('./1.canvas.png').default} alt="On Canvas, start the assignment" style={{width: `50%`}}/>
2. Accept the GitHub Classroom assignment
    * this will copy the starter files for the assignment to a repository named as `<assignment name>-<your github username>`
    * For the first time you log-in you may be asked to choose your name from a list of course roster.

3. Once GitHub Classroom is done configuring your repository, you'll be presented with your private respository link.

    <img src={require('./4.success.png').default} alt="Private repository link" style={{width: `50%`}}/>

4. On GitHub, you'll need to clone down the project to your local machine to start developing the solutions.
    - It's up to you, how you want to clone the reporsitory. You can use GitHub Desktop

## 2. Do the assignment
As this point you should have a working repository with the starter files for the assignment on your computer.

- start modifying/writing your code to satisfy the assignment requirements.
- Make sure you **commit your code frequently** and use a **descriptive commit messages**.
  - the best practice here is to commit at the end of every complete thought. (i.e. `modified the user class to validate the age input`, `updated the self assessment in the README file`)
- Your welcome to use any Development Env. you're comfortable with.
  - I will setup my virtual environment using `PyEnv` and `Poetry` (more information on those tools will be covered in week 3)
  - I will use Jupyter Notebook on `Visual Studio Code (VSCode)`.

## 3. Submit the Repository Link to Canvas.
Once you're done with the assignment:
- Update the (1) Self-Evaluation, (2) Self Reflection, and (3) Citations sections on the `README.md` file.
    <img src={require('./6.readme.png').default} alt="README" style={{width: `70%`}}/>
- Make sure you **Push** your committed changes to GitHub and confirm you can see those changes on your repository on GitHub.
  - *Remember:* Making commits only commits the changes to the local repository. 
- Copy the Repository link and submit to Canvas.
**Remember to:** make sure your code is on GitHub and you didn't just commit it locally.
