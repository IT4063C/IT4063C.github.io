## Common Errors and Issues
**Some of the command line tools I installed, don't seem to be accessible from VSCode integrated Terminal.**
The fix is simpler than you think. Close VSCode and Open it again.
Closing the integrated terminal window and opening a new instance of it doesn't work on Windows. You have to shut the whole application down.

**I want Git Bash to be my default integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code**
