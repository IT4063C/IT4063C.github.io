Not to re-invent the wheel, please follow [this guide from GitHub](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) on Installing Git.

-----------------
## Check the installation

Run the following command in your terminal application:
```bash
git version
```

This should either return the version of git you have installed, or report that the command wasn't found.

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="win" label="Windows">
    <li>You should have a command prompt called "Git Bash". This is the first good sign that your installation was successful.</li>
    <li>Open "Git Bash", "Command Prompt", or "PowerShell" and run the command above</li>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">
    <li>You can use the "Terminal" application to run the command</li>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Installation
### GitHub Desktop
If you're new to git and never used before, I recommend that you download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). This is Graphical User Interface GUI for the git command line tools. That would make getting used to the git flow easier for you.

It also comes with the latest version of git command line tools.

### Git Command Line tools (Git CLI)
Git CLI is the main interface/application for using git on your computer. You'll need to install it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Make sure you get the correct installation for your operating system and device architecutre (32-bit vs 64-bit)
