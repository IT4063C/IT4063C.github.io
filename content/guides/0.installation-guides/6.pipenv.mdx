To install Poetry, you call follow the official [installation instructions](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation/).

I'll copy some of that over here for convinience. But keep it mind this may have changed since copying this.

## prerequiste
- you need python 3.7+ installed
```
python --version
``` 
or 
```
python3 --version
```
or
```
py --version
```
- you need pip installed
```
pip --version
```

## install
```
pip install pipenv --user
```

The installation may indicate to you that you need to update the env. variables. If so, follow the instructions.
