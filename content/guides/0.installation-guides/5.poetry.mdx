To install Poetry, you call follow the official [installation instructions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

I'll copy some of that over here for convinience. But keep it mind this may have changed since copying this.

## For Windows
The following instruction are for windows users not using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

Using powershell, run the following command:
```powershell
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | py -
```

:::note: Note
If you have installed Python through the Microsoft Store, replace `py` with `python` in the command above.
:::

The installer may take care of the following step, but if after you restarted your terminal were still unable to envoke poetry, you'll need to add poetry to your `PATH` environment variable.
the path you need to add to your env. variables is `%APPDATA%\Python\Scripts` on Windows.

## For Linux, macOS, and Windows with WSL

Using your terminal of choice, run the following command:
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

you may be able to run this with just `python` instead of `python3` depending on your system. but some systems still assumes python 2 when you call `python` so it's best to be explicit.

The installer may take care of the following step, but if after you restarted your terminal were still unable to envoke poetry, you'll need to add poetry to your `PATH` environment variable.
the path you need to add to your env. variables is `$HOME/.local/bin` on Linux and macOS.


## Verifying the installation
To make sure you've installed poetry correctly, run the following command:
```bash
poetry --version
```
The results of this is the screenshot you'll need to provide.
