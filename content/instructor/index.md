## Logistics
- Remember to branch out the repo into a semester branch so you have a history of the class repos for every semester.
## Syllabus
- Quizzes after videos
- Create a learning log:
  - what kind of questions can data help you answer. Pick a project early on in the semester, throughout the semester you'll be answering new questions based on the topic you selected for yourself. 
  - a single GitHub Repo for that, with multiple entries
	- 1 college credit represents approximately 1 hour spent in a classroom and 2 hours spent on homework each week. As such, you're expected to put in around 9 hours in this class between reviewing the videos, readings, and working on assignments.
	- release the first 3 modules at the same time
