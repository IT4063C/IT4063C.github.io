## Learning Outcomes

## Checklist 

#### Discussion Board - Final Project Group
Read the introduction. Then complete Part 1 by Sep. 22nd and Part 2 by Sep. 25th.

This discussion is required for all students. For detailed information about how weâ€™ll grade this
assignment, see the discussion rubric.

**Introduction**
In this module, and all through the program you learned about how data can be used to draw insights, affect change, and drive innovation. 

Before you complete this assignment, review the lecture slides, and videos, and think back to these recent
readings:

* Share content related to a unique interests or projects that you'd like to explore using data. This may or may not be the same idea you'll use for your final project.
  * Provide a short description and content regarding the area of interest
  * What's the value for analyzing this topic
  * what do we already know and what else can be learnt?
  * What questions and data sources are thinking of
  * Reach out to students in the university who are studying your topic


In your response to your collegues, reflect on their projects:
- What other areas can they research 
- Share some data sources that could help them in their project
- Do you know someone from that major?

- During our next class session, we'll debrief this discussion. You'll also apply these ideas as you
form your final project teams!


OR 

Bring in the outside world. Encourage students to think about how course concepts relate to current events. For example, in a supply chains course, you might ask students to find a news article related to supply chain disruptions and analyze the situation using concepts from core readings.
