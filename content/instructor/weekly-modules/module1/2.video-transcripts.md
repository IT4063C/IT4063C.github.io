## Welcome Video


Welcome to IT4063C. This is one of last course you have in the Data Analytics Track.
I have 2 objectives for you in this course:
1. to piece together all what you've learned in the track so far. Frame it together in a nice framework that you can apply to your future data analytics projects.
2. dig deeper into the different tools and technologies that you may have already been using, as well as introduce you to new ones.

In the process, we'll discuss skills and techniques to be an effective data analyst, such as effective use of visualization and storytelling. and we'll get an introduction to the basics of Machine Learning. we may not dig too deep into it, but you'll be set on the beginning of your journey and you'd be able to carry forward on your own.

This is a hands-on course, we'll be using Python as the main programming language, with an ecosystem of associated libraries. and will get our hands dirty with some real problem and datasets.

I'm Yahya Gilany. I'm a faculty at the School of Information Technology, and the Technology Lead, and Lead software architect at the Information Technology Solutions Center. My main experience is in software development, especially data-intensive application; application that uses/collects a lot of data and sends it for processing, data analytics, and/or reporting.
Currently, I lead the development of a software eco-system built for the ohio criminal sentencing commission and the state of ohio supreme court. The system will be used to collect sentencing data from the courts and judges and provide a way to tell the story of sentencing in the state of ohio.

I've always had a keen interest in machine learning and in building this course, I was able to reignite that again.

I'm looking forward to working with you all this semester. I hope you're excited for this class too.


## Tools when setting up a development environment

You've heard of anaconda in your career so far in the data analytics program. You can still use that in this class. I just need to reintroduce you to it and explain what it actually means to be using it. I will also show you other alternatives that you can also use (and I will be using in this class)

### Python
Python like any software has many versions, it's continuously publishes new features, bug fixes, security patches. When working on multiple projects, you might find one project using python 2, another using version 3.1 and 3.4, and so on. 

This might mean that every time you work on a different projects, that uses a different version, you may need to reinstall python with the appropriate version. That's ridiculous. No one want to work like that.

### Conda and Anaconda

Conda is an open source package management system and environment management system that allows you to instal multiple versions of software packages and their dependencies and switching easily between them.
It works on Linux, OS X and Windows, and was created for Python programs but can package and distribute any software.

### PyEnv

### VirtualEnvs
