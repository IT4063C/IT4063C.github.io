## Need Help?
  * If you need technical assistance, please ask you question on *[Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a30e5da231a654578a9f04859d49dc410%40thread.tacv2/%25F0%259F%2586%2598%2520Help%2520-%2520Ask%2520Questions?groupId=24ca8848-d758-42dc-9a5f-85467f5ded68&tenantId=f5222e6c-5fc6-48eb-8f03-73db18203b63)*.
      * While I'll do my best to get to your questions as soon as I can, but I will almost always be beat by your fellow classmates.
      * It's a great learning opportunity for you to help other students or to engage in technical discussion to find the answer together.
      * If a TA is assigned to the class, they'll also be monitoring the chat and responding to your questions.
      * If you're not able to come to resolution, please @me/mention me on the question thread.
  * I will try to periodically check on the questions, comment or correct any answers.
  * I highly advise, you regularly check your classmates questions and participate.

## Course Evaluation
The School of Information Technology requires that each course is evaluated each time it is taught.  The School uses a confidential web-based system, CoursEval, for these evaluations.  At the beginning of finals week,you will receive an email from the School Head, with “CoursEval” as the topic.  There is a link on that email that takes you directly to the evaluation.  The online system is anonymous.  I will receive only a summary report of combined data after final grades have been submitted.

As an instructor, I greatly value your input regarding the strengths and areas for improvement of this course.  Your feedback is essential for me to continually improve instruction and provide for quality student learning and outcomes.

## Assignment Submission Workflow and Expectations
- Accept the GitHub Classroom assignment
  - this will copy the starter files for the assignment to a repository named as `<assignment name>-<your github username>`
- Clone down the project to your computer.
- start modifying/writing your code to satisfy the assignment requirements.
- Make sure you commit your code frequently and use a descriptive commit messages.
  - the best practice here is to commit at the end of every complete thought. (i.e. `modified the user class to validate the age input`, `updated the self assessment in the README file`)
- Once you're done with the assignment, confirm that you've updated the self evaluation and added any notes or reflections you had.
- Copy the Repository link and submit to Canvas.

**Remember to:** make sure your code is on GitHub and you didn't just commit it locally.
