## Announcements
Welcome to IT4063C! I'm excited to have you in the class and look forward to your _contributions to the learning community._

To begin, I recommend taking a few minutes to review the course syllabus, and explore the material weâ€™ll cover each week. 
The course requires some technologies setup, all of this would be available through the sandbox, however, if you'd like to do this on your computer, please review the installation setup. Click Discussions to see forums where you can discuss the course material with fellow students taking the class.

If you have questions about course content, please post them on Teams Forum (not email) to get help from others in the course and for my response to be shared with all.

Good luck as you get started, and I hope you enjoy the course!
