In some of the assignments, you may be asked to update the badge link on the repository README file. 

* Click on the **Actions** Tab at the top of your repository.
  * ![image001](assets/image001.png)
* Navigate to the **Assignment Checks** action job.
  * ![image002](assets/image002.png)
* Copy the badge.
  * ![image003](assets/image003.png)

P.S.: In most assignments, I created a small script that automatically updates the link for you when you install the repository's dependencies using `npm install`
